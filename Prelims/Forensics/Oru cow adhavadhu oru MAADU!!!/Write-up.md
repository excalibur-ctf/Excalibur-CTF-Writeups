Description:
This is one of the pics that you can hear. The image speaks louder than you think. If i'm not wrong, scientifically, the right word will bring out the flag.

The description hints to listen to the image. So we must use "strings" command.

Command : strings maadu.jpg.jpeg

<img width="932" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df860404-9066-4a2d-838d-3874fd1e1292" />

Now at the end of the strings we can see the flag.

Flag : EXC{5tr1ng5_p44th4_f14g_1rukkum}
