## Description
Hogwarts’ enchanted login gate protects access to the Great Hall. Unfortunately, the Ministry trusted the job to a sleepy intern who mixed ancient magic with unsafe database spells.

Your task is to authenticate without knowing any valid wizard credentials. The login scroll checks your input against the castle’s registry, but the spell casting is… flawed.

Can you manipulate the charm, bypass the wards, and prove you belong inside Hogwarts?
